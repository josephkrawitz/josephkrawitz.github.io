        <h2 id="Morning-1">Morning: Tenryuji Temple, Iwatayama Monkey Park</h2>
        <p>We had another early start to the day in order to ensure we got on the bus up to the northwestern corner of Kyoto: <b>Arashiyama</b>. 
            Most of the attractions in this district open at 9am, so I made a quick adjustment to the order on the itinerary, and we started at the one temple that opened at 8:30, <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2869.jpeg">Tenryu-ji Temple</span>. It features multiple beautiful gardens, each of a different style, including a <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5484.jpeg">zen rock garden</span>, a moss garden, a <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/Japan - 94 of 485.jpeg">still lake</span>, and a <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2872.jpeg">trickling brook</span>. There were multiple paths to explore and of course, beautifully bloomed <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5518.jpeg">sakura</span>. There was a long 'indoor' path along the temple and through a wooden covered walkway, across all of which we walked without our shoes. I really enjoyed seeing the <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5529.jpeg">cherry blossoms</span>, plus <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5540.jpeg">sakura azalea</span> and <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5546.jpeg">other flowers</span> in bloom here 
            <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5549.jpeg">up close</span>.
        </p>

            <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/tenryuji.jpeg">Goshuin</span> collected.
        </p>

        <p>
            After leaving here, we each got a skewer of <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/Japan - 124 of 485.jpeg">dango</span> from a street vendor in lieu of breakfast. Dango are sweet balls of glutinous rice flour on a bamboo skewer. Basically, balls coated in a sweet syrup and dusted with something that I thought was peanut? Yummy. From there we crossed back over the bridge and began the trek up the mountainside (again. This trip was very themed around stairs and hills apparently).
        </p>

        <div class="note"><strong>Editor's note:</strong>  I was being serious about the stairs.

            They went like that for a while.
        </div>

        <p>But what could possibly be worth all those extra steps? Well, 
            <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/japanpic - 2.jpeg">monkeys. </span>
            There is an enclosure you can enter to feed monkeys through a cage (you are the one inside the cage) but  we didn't do 
            that. Hungry monkeys can go there. Some just chill in the human area. Others are out on the mountainside doing whatever 
            they do.</p>

        <p>That is, they just chill and do their own thing until feeding time. The man who had previously been mostly repeating the 
            directions to keep your distance, etc, came out and yelled OYYYYYY a couple of times. For the next two minutes, the 
            surrounding area's monkeys made their way up or down the mountain to amass at the source of the call. They congregated at 
            the main human platform, where humans had been shepherded by the staff and spread out along the perimeter. They played the 
            can-can song and threw food out so the monkeys would go around and the visitors could be sure to have a good close look at 
            the fellas. We only stayed for the feeding because it was literally in 5 minutes as of when we felt good so hey, it won't 
            really make for nice natural photos but we might as well. And it was fun enough. There was also a baby which was amusing.
        </p>
        <img src="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5681.jpeg" alt="baby monkey"><p></p>

        <p>It's a good thing we were wrapping that up when we did, because as we began to descend towards civilization, it began to 
            rain. Fortunately, there was a covered bench along the way that we sat at when it picked up a bit, so we could plan out 
            our next moves. Down in the main town area by the bridge etc, we would be able to take a bus up the hill as planned to a 
            temple and then work our way down. And by the looks of the schedule, we would have time to look around for a cafe or 
            something, too.</p>

        <p>
            Well, that was the plan, and is <em>close</em> to what happened. The rain did intervene slightly. We got down off the mountainside and walked down the path along the river while checking out the street foods and restaurants as we passed them. The rain started to come down hard, though, so we took shelter under an overhang in Arashiyama Park. There was still enough time to try to wait it out before having to head back to catch the bus. That worked out. When it let up, we went back and found the right bus stop with a few minutes to spare. That spare time was spent enjoying some nice cold <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/Japan - 149 of 485.jpeg"> vending machine coffee drinks</span>.

        <h2 id="Afternoon-1">Early Afternoon: Adashino Nenbutsuji, Lunch, Gioji, Jojakkoji, Okochi Sanso Garden, Bamboo Grove</h2>

        <p>
            Side note, we saw a <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2912.jpeg">clown</span> outside from the bus. So that was weird.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyways, we got up the hill. The bus stop was only a little ways off from our destination, but since this is a town built 
            on a very steep incline, the under/overpass roads made it tough to figure out where to go. On the other hand, what a 
            lovely place to wander.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once we figured out that there were some stairs to go down, and where they were, it was simple to reach the quiet <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/Japan15.jpeg">Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple</span>. There are a few features of note here. The first is that there are >1200 stone heads, many covered in moss. Most of their features were pretty washed out, though, or maybe I wasn't looking at them right.
        </p>

        <img src="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_5723.jpeg" alt="Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple">

        <p>
            Significantly less spiritually engaging was their collection of <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/Japan - 152 of 485.jpeg">Tanuki statues</span>. Tanuki are Japanese raccoon dogs, a real animal but also a mythical creature in Japanese folklore. They are said to be mischievous shapeshifters, and while the photo I attached does a good job of hiding it, they famously have gigantic testicles. It looks like people rub them for good luck, like one might with a Buddha's belly, based on the one that was <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2866.jpeg">stationed outside our hotel</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This temple was also unique in another way: photography inside the main halls is almost always prohibited, but here, there was actually a sign encouring it. It was good to have the opportunity to share a firsthand view of a temple's shrines. There were many beautiful rooms like these across our tour of various temples in Japan, usually for visitors to view but not enter. Enjoy!

            All of this makes Adashino Nenbutsuji a must-see in Arashiyama. However, the feature that originally drew me to it was its 
            bamboo grove, which is hidden around the back. When I learned about it, there was no question that the reduced foot traffic would make up for the smaller size compared to the extremely overcrowded <b>Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</b>. This is the reason it was recommended and why it was such an easy choice to include it in my list. As expected, it was short, but you could get a photo without strangers in the background, meaning it was a big win. Beyond that, it was quiet and peaceful and the bamboo is huge and only some light dappled through and it was all quite nice.

            Once we were done at the temple, we went to a recommended restaurant for lunch: <b>Cafe Gabu</b>. It was in this same area, 
            and again, the walk around this quiet side of town was wonderful. The main thing I felt was missing from my itinerary was 
            the rural mountain towns, and this was helping a bit to scratch that itch.</p>
        
        <img src="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2927.jpeg" alt="Route to Cafe Gabu Arashiyama">

        <p>
            The restaurant was essentially a small cafe on the hill and it had a wonderful view to enjoy while eating outside. Jacob 
            had beef gyuudon and I had their specialty curry. Jacob also had a yuzu soda, and I stuck to tea. It was all good but 
            honestly the highlight was the Japanese sweet potato in mine... it was so good... it was like, unbelievable, honestly.

        <p>
            After our lunch, we walked down <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/Japan - 181 of 485.jpeg">Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street</span>, which we were able to find fairly easily now that we had a grasp of the vertical overlap of streets here. This street has some vendors but we were mainly focused on the Meiji-period architecture. There were also a couple of small temples and shrines we chanced upon on the walk, which led us to <b>Gioji Temple</b>. This also had a moss garden, bamboo, and stairs. From there it was just a little longer down the road to <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2934.jpeg" alt="Jojakoji">Jojakkoji Temple</span>, which if you can believe it, also had <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2932.jpeg" alt="Jojakoji">stairs</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            These two temples are supposed to really shine in the autumn, as they have many maple trees that turn wonderful colors.
        </p>

        <p>
            After that was the <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/Japan - 184 of 485.jpeg">Okochi Sanso Gardens</span>, belonging formerly to a famous early Japanese film actor. It was a lovely vista and 
            the entry fee meant that even though (it turns out, I hadn't realized) it is right next to the end of the famous busy bamboo grove, most people don't go in there. They also had a <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2938.jpeg">pretty tea room</span> to enter and multiple types of tea you could try included with entry, with a relaxing bamboo view.
        </p>

            <img src="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2947.jpeg" alt="Okochi Sanso Garden">

        <p>
            Unfortunately, the only logical way back to our bus stop to return to our base neighborhood was through the dreaded plague 
            of humanity filling the <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2949.jpeg">Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</span>. Fortunately we had a nice bamboo experience already so we were able to focus on moving forward through this one.

        <h2 id="Evening-1">Evening: Central/Eastern Kyoto</h2>

        <p>
            Back at Kyoto Station, we were able to check another marked location off my list. It wasn't easy; I was warned that it was kind of hard to find and I can confirm there was an entire area of the station that was tucked away such that it was almost exclusively locals who knew how to navigate there. We got to the small outpost of <b>Nakamura Tokichi</b>, a specialty matcha brand, and did our approximation of a tea ceremony. The <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2954.jpeg">tea</span> was good, but what they do with the matcha goes <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/20250406_184930.jpg">beyond that</span>.
        </p>

            <img src="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2957.jpeg" alt="Nakamura Tokichi Kyoto Station">

        <p>
            Should've bought more stuff from them, but we were mostly focused on moving on from this appetizer to the main meal so we didn't stop back in their shop. By the time we left and wanted to find actual dinner, it became a bit of a scramble. Places were closed, or had enormous lines, or were all-smoking… we ended up in a little pizza place, which was alright. The <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/20250406_195410.jpg">nighttime walk around the city</span> came with some <span class="modal-trigger" data-image="Japan Blog/Photos/IMG_2959.jpeg">nice views</span>.
